# How Console IO is done in XV6

When we setup it up and run `make qemu`, we get into the unix shell like environment.

But how doe this terminal thing work?

First of all, when you run `make qemu`, what actually happen underneath is `qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt ...`, where virt is a ["RISC-V machine with 16550a UART and VirtIO MMIO"][https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/hw/riscv/virt.c#L6]. When QEMU emulates a RISC-V `virt` virtual machine, and one of the key components of this emulation is the virtual machine’s serial console or UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) interface. 

By default, QEMU maps this UART to the standard input (stdin) and output (stdout) of the host system terminal from which you started QEMU, allowing the host terminal to function as the virtual machine’s console. This way, any output the virtual machine would send to its UART is sent to your host’s terminal window, and any input you provide through the host terminal is sent to the virtual machine.

Now we can focus on xv6 side.

When the first core gets started and jumps into main(), the very first thing it does is to init the console:

Let's use http://byterunner.com/16550.html as a reference to understand the code related to UART, mainly in kernel/uart.c, as well as the code using it in kernel/console.c.

## About 16550 and 16550A

The 16550 and 16550A are both UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) chips, but the 16550A is an improved version of the original 16550. Here are the key differences:

16550:

The original version of the UART.

It includes a 16-byte FIFO buffer (First-In-First-Out) to store incoming and outgoing data. However, the FIFO buffer in the 16550 had a bug that caused unreliable data handling.

16550A:

The 16550A fixed the bugs present in the 16550 and ensured that the 16-byte FIFO buffer worked correctly.
It is much more reliable for high-speed serial communication due to this improvement.
The 16550A became the standard and is commonly referred to when talking about 16550 UARTs.
In practice, when people refer to the "16550," they often mean the improved 16550A, as the original version is rarely used due to its issues.

## 38.4K

You might have already noticed that `uartinit()` set the baud rate to 38.4k by putting the divisor latch value to 3.

But why 38.4k?

Well, if we run `qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt,dumpdtb=virt.out` then `fdtdump virt.out`. We will see something:

```
        serial@10000000 {
            interrupts = <0x0000000a>;
            interrupt-parent = <0x00000003>;
            clock-frequency = <0x00384000>;
            reg = <0x00000000 0x10000000 0x00000000 0x00000100>;
            compatible = "ns16550a";
        };
```
It tells us that qemu virt machine has uart clock set as 0x38400 (3.686400MHz). Hmmm...
